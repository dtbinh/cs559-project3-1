To do list:

Goal: Deferred Shading
[X] Shader support - to be able to do MRT (see below), we need shaders.
                     Plus, they look awesome.
[X] Render To Target (RTT) - Render to a texture instead of the screen buffer.
                             This is also a prerequisite to MRT.
[ ] Multiple Render Targets (MRT) - Deferred shading requires that we write out
                                    information to multiple render targets at
                                    once so that we don't have to render the
                                    scene multiple times.
[X] Multiple Texture Support - We need to be able to feed multiple textures into
                               one shader in order to do deferred rendering
                               (and other neat tricks).
[ ] Post processing - To use our render targets to create a final lit scene, we
                      need to render a full-screen texture to the screen. This
                      is extremely simple after RTT is done.

Goal: High Dynamic Range
[ ] RTT with floating-point textures - This should be pretty simple after basic
                                       RTT is done since OpenGL already supports
                                       them.
[ ] Post processing - See above


Goal: Passing Grade (List of requirements, per project page)
Your town must have:
[X]	Multiple objects moving at any time (besides the ones in the sample code if you use sample code)
		10 happy fun balls, currently
		
[ ]	Multiple different types of behaviors (besides the ones in the sample code if you use sample code)

[X]	Multiple different types of buildings / scenery (besides the ones in the sample code if you use sample code)
		all new buildings
		
[X]	Multiple new textures. Some must be hand painted. Some must not be flat (that is, it must wrap onto multiple polygons)
		All textures are new and all are "hand painted".
		All buildings are non-flat
		
[X]	You must attempt "enough" technical challenges (see the technical challenges page).
		Deferred shading, above, multitexture support. others?
		
[ ]	You must have an articulated object (that moves its articulation) per person.

[X]	You program must work at a sufficient frame rate (which isn't hard since the storm computers are so fast).
		certainly does with out debug
		
[ ]	You must add something that is affected by the time of day. (You must be able to control the time of day. The time of day should affect the lighting and the actions that occur.)

[ ]	You must use at least one type of "advanced" texture mapping, for example, projective (slide projector) texturing, environment mapping, 
	which we discussed in class. Or you can try multi-texturing. Furthermore, you can try bump mapping, or shadow mapping, which we didn't say how to implement them in detail; Here are some online tutorials for bump mapping and shadow mapping. (If you want to pick something not on this list, you may want to check with us to make sure it counts)
		MT working, just not ingame yet

[X]	You must be able to fly around the town to look at things.
		done on day one

[ ]	You must have "shortcuts" to go directly to places where particularly interesting things are.
