To do list:

Goal: Deferred Shading
[X] Shader support - to be able to do MRT (see below), we need shaders.
                     Plus, they look awesome.
[X] Render To Target (RTT) - Render to a texture instead of the screen buffer.
                             This is also a prerequisite to MRT.
[ ] Multiple Render Targets (MRT) - Deferred shading requires that we write out
                                    information to multiple render targets at
									once so that we don't have to render the
									scene multiple times.
[ ] Post processing - To use our render targets to create a final lit scene, we
                      need to render a full-screen texture to the screen. This
					  is extremely simple after RTT is done.

Goal: High Dynamic Range
[ ] RTT with floating-point textures - This should be pretty simple after basic
                                       RTT is done since OpenGL already supports
									   them.
[ ] Post processing - See above
